# NFT Collection

A Dapp for launching an NFT collection.
Owner of the deployed contract can start presale, then only whithelisted addresses from [Whitelist Dapp](https://github.com/josayko/Whitelist-Dapp)
can mint during a certain period of time (default to 5 minutes).
After presale ends, anyone can public mint an NFT.

> This project is heavily inspired by [LearnWeb3DAO - NFT Collection](https://github.com/LearnWeb3DAO/NFT-Collection)

- This project differs from the original with the use of [`Rainbow Kit`](https://github.com/rainbow-me/rainbow) and [`wagmi`](https://github.com/tmm/wagmi) instead of `web3Modal` with `ethers`. Moreover, some errors handling and improvements has been added: clearInterval in useEffect return, reactivity when switching between accounts or wrong network, etc...

- The app has been deployed with Vercel at
  https://nft-collection-josayko.vercel.app/, and the max supply has been set to 20 NFTs
- You can deploy a new instance of the smart contract and run the frontend app locally if the max supply has been reached
